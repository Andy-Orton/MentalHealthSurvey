            <br>(PHQ-9)</h1>
    <div id = "warning">
            <p><b>Attention Snow College Students:</b>  Taking the PHQ-9 and/or the GAD-7 will create a score with suggested possibilities about your current level of functioning related to anxiety and/or depression.  Scores do not indicate that you have a diagnosis of depression or anxiety but are indicators that suggest whether there is a need for further evaluation.  To obtain a clear diagnosis, download a copy of your test results and bring them with you to the Counseling & Wellness Center to schedule an appointment.  You may also select the option to enter your name, contact information and score results and have them sent to the counseling office directly. <br> </p>
            <p>If you feel depressed and would like to talk with someone at a time that a counselor is not available on campus, please download the <b>SAFE UT</b> app on your phone and sign up under Snow College, Ephraim.  You can communicate with a licensed counselor 24 hours a day directly from the app.</p>
            <p><b>If you are in crisis or considering suicide please contact our office immediately at 435-283-7136 or if it is emergency or if we are not presently in the office, please call 911 for assistance.  </b></p>
